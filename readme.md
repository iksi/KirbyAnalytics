# Analytics plugin for Kirby

## What is it?

Adds a Google Analytics code automatically as soon as the site is not running on localhost.

## Why use it?

I maded it because I often forgot to uncomment the Google Analytics code after uploading changes to the live site.

## How to use it?

Put the `analytics` folder in `/site/plugins` and add a Google Analytics id to your config. The analytics id is a string like `UA-000000-01`.

```PHP
c::set('google.analytics_id', 'UA-000000-01');
```

Instead of setting the `analytics_id` in your `config.php` file you can also add it as site variable. The plugin will check for an id in `config.php` and if it canâ€™t find one it will look for a site variable.

Then you can simply call it from a template or snippet:

```PHP
<?php echo analytics() ?>
```
